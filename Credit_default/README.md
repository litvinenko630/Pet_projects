# Credit Default

The Credit Default project aims to develop a predictive model that can accurately predict the likelihood of a borrower defaulting on a loan. The project utilizes machine learning techniques to analyze various factors and historical data to make predictions.

## Objectives

The main objectives of the Credit Default project are:

1. **Data Preparation**: Collect and preprocess a diverse dataset containing information about borrowers, loan applications, financial history, credit scores, and other relevant features.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Perform comprehensive data exploration and analysis to gain insights into the dataset. Identify patterns, correlations, and potential factors that contribute to credit default.

3. **Feature Engineering**: Select and engineer meaningful features from the available dataset to improve the predictive power of the model. This may include creating new variables, transforming existing ones, or incorporating external data sources.

4. **Model Training**: Build and train machine learning models using various algorithms, such as logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, or gradient boosting, to predict credit default. Experiment with different models and techniques to achieve the best performance.

5. **Model Evaluation**: Assess the performance of the trained models using appropriate evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Fine-tune the models to optimize their performance and handle any imbalances or biases in the dataset.

6. **Deployment**: Deploy the final trained model into a production environment where it can be used to predict credit default for new loan applications. Implement necessary infrastructure and interfaces to enable seamless integration with existing systems.


## Project Structure

The project consists of the following components:

- `catboost_info`: This directory contains documentation and information about the CatBoost algorithm. It provides details about the algorithm's features, parameters, and usage instructions.

- `data`: This directory holds the dataset used in the project. It contains the necessary data files for analyzing credit default, including both the training and testing datasets.

- `model`: This directory stores the trained CatBoost models generated during the project. These models can be used for predicting credit default or further analysis.

- `prepared_data`: This directory contains preprocessed or transformed versions of the original dataset. It includes data that has been cleaned, normalized, encoded, or feature-engineered to prepare it for input into the CatBoost model.

- `scaler`: This directory contains scripts or files related to data scaling or normalization. These files are used to preprocess the data and bring it to a standardized scale before training the CatBoost model.

- `SLitvinenko_solution.ipynb`: This Jupyter notebook presents the solution provided by SLitvinenko. It includes code, explanations, and results related to the credit default project. It serves as a reference and example for implementing the CatBoost algorithm.
