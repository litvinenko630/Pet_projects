# Pet_projects


This repository is dedicated to my pet projects, which I have created for the purpose of studying, self-improvement, and building my portfolio.

## Goals

The main goals of this repository are:

1. **Study**: I aim to enhance my skills and knowledge in various areas by working on these pet projects. They serve as a practical way for me to learn new technologies, programming languages, algorithms, and concepts.

2. **Self-Improvement**: Through these projects, I strive to improve my problem-solving abilities, coding techniques, software design, and project management skills. By tackling different challenges and exploring new ideas, I can continuously grow as a developer.

3. **Building a Portfolio**: These pet projects are valuable additions to my portfolio. They demonstrate my capabilities, creativity, and dedication to personal growth. They showcase my ability to apply my skills to real-world scenarios and solve practical problems.

## Project Structure

Each project in this repository is contained within its own folder. The folder name represents the project's name or topic. Within each project folder, you can find the project's source code, documentation, and any additional resources or files that are relevant to the project.

## Projects

Here are some of the projects you can find in this repository:

1. **Project Name**: Credit default.
   
The Credit Default project aims to develop a predictive model that can accurately predict the likelihood of a borrower defaulting on a loan. The project utilizes machine learning techniques to analyze various factors and historical data to make predictions.

2. **Project Name**: Spaceship Titanic.

The aim of this project is to build a predictive model using machine learning techniques to determine whether passengers on the Spaceship Titanic were transported to another dimension. The project involves comprehensive data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and feature engineering to prepare the dataset for training. The model will be fine-tuned using hyperparameter optimization for optimal performance. The ultimate goal is to make accurate predictions on the test data and submit the results for evaluation and ranking on Kaggle's Spaceship Titanic competition. The README.md file provides an overview of the project's objectives, methodology, and steps taken to achieve the final predictions.

3. **Project Name**: Password Strength Checker.

The Password Strength Checker project aims to develop an application that assesses the robustness of passwords. Leveraging machine learning algorithms, the application predicts the strength of a given password, providing users with insights into its vulnerability. The project entails data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and the implementation of feature engineering techniques to optimize the dataset for model training. Through fine-tuning and hyperparameter optimization, the model strives for maximum accuracy in evaluating password strength. The README.md file outlines the project's objectives, methodology, and the systematic approach taken to achieve reliable password strength predictions.

4. **Project Name**: Insurance Claims (Imbalanced Classes).

This project aims to develop and evaluate a predictive model for insurance claims likelihood assessment, despite the inherent class imbalance in the dataset, sourced from [statso.io](https://statso.io/training-models-on-imbalanced-data-case-study/). The model's objective is to maintain high predictive accuracy across both classes to enable insurers to effectively assess risk and allocate resources. To achieve this, the project involves utilizing machine learning techniques such as decision trees, random forests, while addressing class imbalance through oversampling method during model training. Model evaluation will be conducted using precision, recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC, and cross-validation to ensure robust assessment and fine-tuning of model parameters for improved performance. Ultimately, the project aims to provide actionable insights and recommendations based on the model's predictions to enhance insurers' risk assessment and resource allocation processes.

5. **Project Name**: Health Insurance Charges Prediction (Regression).

This project aims to develop a predictive model for health insurance premium prediction, leveraging a dataset comprising crucial variables such as age, gender, BMI, smoking status, region of residence, number of children, and insurance premium charges. By analyzing these factors, the model seeks to accurately estimate insurance premiums and explore the influence of various demographic and lifestyle factors on premium costs. Ultimately, the project seeks to enhance insurers' risk assessment capabilities, enabling more informed decision-making in resource allocation and improving the overall efficiency of the health insurance industry.

6. **Project Name**: House Prices Prediction (Regression).

House price prediction involves analyzing various factors to estimate the selling price of residential properties. This process is crucial for both buyers and sellers to make informed decisions about real estate transactions. The dataset used for house price prediction comprises numerous features, including the property's sale price, zoning classification, lot size, building type, overall quality, and other relevant attributes. These variables provide essential insights into property characteristics, which are instrumental in training predictive models.
