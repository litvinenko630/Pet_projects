## Projects

Here are some of the projects you can find in this repository:

1. **Project Name**: Credit default.
   
The Credit Default project aims to develop a predictive model that can accurately predict the likelihood of a borrower defaulting on a loan. The project utilizes machine learning techniques to analyze various factors and historical data to make predictions.

2. **Project Name**: Spaceship Titanic.

The aim of this project is to build a predictive model using machine learning techniques to determine whether passengers on the Spaceship Titanic were transported to another dimension. The project involves comprehensive data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and feature engineering to prepare the dataset for training. The model will be fine-tuned using hyperparameter optimization for optimal performance. The ultimate goal is to make accurate predictions on the test data and submit the results for evaluation and ranking on Kaggle's Spaceship Titanic competition. The README.md file provides an overview of the project's objectives, methodology, and steps taken to achieve the final predictions.

3. **Project Name**: Password Strength Checker.

The Password Strength Checker project aims to develop an application that assesses the robustness of passwords. Leveraging machine learning algorithms, the application predicts the strength of a given password, providing users with insights into its vulnerability. The project entails data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and the implementation of feature engineering techniques to optimize the dataset for model training. Through fine-tuning and hyperparameter optimization, the model strives for maximum accuracy in evaluating password strength. The README.md file outlines the project's objectives, methodology, and the systematic approach taken to achieve reliable password strength predictions.

4. **Project Name**: Insurance Claims (Imbalanced Classes).

This project aims to develop and evaluate a predictive model for insurance claims likelihood assessment, despite the inherent class imbalance in the dataset, sourced from [statso.io](https://statso.io/training-models-on-imbalanced-data-case-study/). The model's objective is to maintain high predictive accuracy across both classes to enable insurers to effectively assess risk and allocate resources. To achieve this, the project involves utilizing machine learning techniques such as decision trees, random forests, while addressing class imbalance through oversampling method during model training. Model evaluation will be conducted using precision, recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC, and cross-validation to ensure robust assessment and fine-tuning of model parameters for improved performance. Ultimately, the project aims to provide actionable insights and recommendations based on the model's predictions to enhance insurers' risk assessment and resource allocation processes.

5. **Project Name**: Health Insurance Charges Prediction (Regression).

This project aims to develop a predictive model for health insurance premium prediction, leveraging a dataset comprising crucial variables such as age, gender, BMI, smoking status, region of residence, number of children, and insurance premium charges. By analyzing these factors, the model seeks to accurately estimate insurance premiums and explore the influence of various demographic and lifestyle factors on premium costs. Ultimately, the project seeks to enhance insurers' risk assessment capabilities, enabling more informed decision-making in resource allocation and improving the overall efficiency of the health insurance industry.

6. **Project Name**: House Prices Prediction (Regression).

House price prediction involves analyzing various factors to estimate the selling price of residential properties. This process is crucial for both buyers and sellers to make informed decisions about real estate transactions. The dataset used for house price prediction comprises numerous features, including the property's sale price, zoning classification, lot size, building type, overall quality, and other relevant attributes. These variables provide essential insights into property characteristics, which are instrumental in training predictive models.

7. **Project Name**: Real Estate Prediction (Regression and Dash App).

By delving into regression techniques, I aim to deepen my understanding of predictive modeling and its application in real-world scenarios. The inclusion of a Dash App adds an interactive dimension, allowing users to explore and visualize the predictions effortlessly. This project not only showcases my technical prowess but also underscores my dedication to creating practical solutions that leverage advanced analytics for informed decision-making in the real estate domain.

8. **Project Name**: Obesity Risk (Multivariate Analysis and Interactive Visualization).

The Obesity Influence Analysis project reflects my dedication to advancing my expertise in data science and machine learning. This project focuses on multivariate analysis to explore the intricate relationships between various factors and their impact on obesity types. The integration of an interactive visualization tool enhances user engagement, enabling a hands-on approach to understanding the data. This endeavor not only demonstrates my analytical capabilities but also my commitment to developing actionable insights that support healthcare professionals, policy makers, and individuals in making evidence-based health and lifestyle decisions.

9. **Project Name**: Bank Churn Analysis (Predictive Modeling and Interactive Dashboard).

This project is centered around predictive modeling, utilizing regression techniques to ascertain the influence of various factors on bank churn rates. The incorporation of an interactive dashboard allows for a dynamic exploration and visualization of the predictive outcomes. This initiative not only demonstrates my technical acumen but also my commitment to devising practical, data-driven solutions that aid financial institutions, policy makers, and individuals in making well-informed decisions about customer retention strategies.

10. **Project Name**: Flood Probability Prediction (Regression).

This project aims to develop a comprehensive understanding of the relationships between different factors and flood prediction, to innvestigate the impact of various factors such as monsoon intensity, topography drainage, river management, deforestation, urbanization, climate change, dams quality, siltation, agricultural practices, encroachments, ineffective disaster preparedness, drainage systems, coastal vulnerability, landslides, watersheds, deteriorating infrastructure, population score, wetland loss, inadequate planning, and political factors on flood probability. Provide valuable insights to authorities, policymakers, and individuals to facilitate better decision-making regarding flood risk management and mitigation strategies.

11. **Project Name**: Student Outcome Prediction (Multiclass Classification).

This project aims to develop a deep understanding of the multitude of factors influencing student outcomes, utilizing demographic and academic data. The analysis will shed light on how various parameters such as demographic details, previous qualifications, and academic performance affect student outcomes, providing crucial insights for educational institutions, data analysts, and researchers to optimize student support and resource allocation strategies.
